Test
----
- write unit tests
- changes to XML format and validation
    - pygcam and also gcammcs (results, parameters, scenarios)
- Changes to setup.py and related bits

Cleanup
-------
- Eliminate "scenarios.xml" from gcammcs? Obviated by project.xml?
- chart.py has some app-specific code. refactor it.
- Learn how to insert documentation amidst argparse-generated docs.
    - Link to XML documentation for project, landProtection, etc.

Features
--------
- Flag to XML-based commands to just validate input file without other action

- Generalize as many of the Bioenergy and Refining methods as possible
    - Goal should be to not need any sector-based methods

- Integrate gcam-driver stuff from Robert
    - Consider re-implementing using jug

Document
--------
- Plugin protocol
    - class 'Plugin' or variable PluginClass which identifies classname
    - addArgs()
    - run(args, tool)
    - when it gets loaded and run
    - plugins should use logging

- Assumptions behind setup code

- Adding otaq2016.pth and pygcam.pth (or one file with both)

Tasks
- Test diff cmd
- Test constraint cmds
- Test land protection cmd
    - Simplify to eliminate complicated cmdline opts?
- Should constraint commands remain plugins?
    - They're for use by biofuel studies only?
    - If so, setup.py can call these by importing them directly.
    - Perhaps split out generic function from domain-specific
- Elim. builtin plugins dir?
- Update documentation
- Update project.xml in gcam-proj
- Test everything again on Windows
