Test
----
- logging
- write unit tests
- changes to XML format and validation
    - pygcam and also gcammcs (results, parameters, scenarios)
- Changes to setup.py and related bits
- Charting -- figure out what to do with calling parseArgs inside loop
- Test scripts on Windows

Cleanup
-------
- Remove args parsing from pygcam modules in favor of having it in plugins
- BatchQuery class deprecated?
- Eliminate "scenarios.xml" from gcammcs? Obviated by project.xml?
- chart.py has some app-specific code. refactor it.
- Learn how to insert documentation amidst argparse-generated docs.
    - Link to XML documentation for project, landProtection, etc.
    - Put all XML doc in one file?

Features
--------
- Load only required plugins?
    - Have filename be name of command, e.g., "query" => query_plugin.py; load first one found
    - Only load all plugins if the main help command is run (?)

- Flag to XML-based commands to just validate input file without other action

- Generalize as many of the Bioenergy and Refining methods as possible
    - Goal should be to not need any sector-based methods

- Integrate gcam-driver stuff from Robert
    - Consider re-implementing using jug

Document
--------
- Plugin protocol
    - class 'Plugin' or variable PluginClass which identifies classname
    - addArgs()
    - run(args)
    - when it gets loaded and run
    - plugins should use logging

- Assumptions behind setup code
