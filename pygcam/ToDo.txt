Config changes
===============
- Renamed:
  GCAM.ModelInterface => GCAM.MI.Dir
  GCAM.JavaArgs       => GCAM.MI.JavaArgs
  GCAM.JavaLibPath    => GCAM.MI.ClassPath
  GCAM.ModelInterfaceLogFile => GCAM.MI.LogFile
  GCAM.UseVirtualBuffer => GCAM.MI.UseVirtualBuffer

- New:
  GCAM.MI.JarFile      = %(GCAM.MI.Dir)s/ModelInterface.jar
  GCAM.MI.BatchCommand = java %(GCAM.JavaArgs)s -cp %(GCAM.ClassPath)s ModelInterface/InterfaceMain -b {batchFile}

  GCAM.MI.ClassPath

  GCAM.SandboxProjectDir
  GCAM.SandboxRefWorkspace
  GCAM.SandboxDir is now populated using GCAM.ScenarioGroup, which may be empty

- Code:
Rather than setting vars opaquely in config.py, created files per OS with
OS-specific values, at most one of which is read after reading system.cfg.

On PIC: Add XMLDBDriver.jar to .../libs/jars. No sense treating this differently.

-------------
AUGUST 2 2016
-------------
New rule simplification:
1. Sources are located using GCAM.ProjectDir (e.g., GCAM.ProjectSandbox = {projectDir}/sandbox)
2. {projectDir}/sandbox is source for setupWorkspace(), whether single run or MCS.
3. In non-MCS, links back to GCAM.ProjectSandbox are used where appropriate (if possible)
4. "run" sub-command uses --workspace arg to set GCAM.RunWorkspace for all sub-commands to see
5. {GCAM.RunWorkspace}/xmlsrc is source used by setup, with results written to

From gcammcs:

    gt run --mcs --workspace
or
    gt --mcs --workspace=x run

Issue is whether other commands, like "gt chart", "gt diff" and so on can be used on
specific MCS workspaces by passing --workspace to gt, or if all commands need to
have this parameters, which seems burdensome.

Process in MCS:
1. gcammcs new: creates {GCAM.MCS.ProjectSandbox} by copying/linking {GCAM.ProjectSandbox}
2. gcammcs queue: runGCAM() calls gcamtool for individual steps, with --workspace={expDir}
3.

- Finish testing non-MCS mode, including on otaq2016 (has groupDir)
- Finish developing MCS mode

- Modify gcammcs to:
  - link {expDir}/local-xml to {simDir}/local-xml (already created)
  - create {expDir}/dyn-xml for per-trial generation

- Eliminate generators from scenarios.py and use project.xml @setup instead.

- In generators, expect baseline to be in ../../{baseline}, relative to "exe".

Bugs
====
- Need fix on Windows for calling "java WriteLocalBaseXDB" to get jre path
  using the new XMLDBDriver.jar, since Write... no longer has a main.

- Several tables didn't populate: output, program, code, region. Anomaly or bug?

- Diff without -i is still interpolating.

- There's a subtle problem with repeated use of GcamTool as top-level call.
  First symptom is query list is repeated. Seems to be stale state from
  prior invocation, suggesting a need to re-initialize (class vars?) when
  called from top-level.
  - in any case, all the start-up stuff is rerun needlessly, currently

- To try:
  - Move run dir back to /pic/scratch/plev920

Cleanup
=======
- @setup should call the prequery when GCAM.BatchMultipleQueries
  so this is done just once for all trials

- "batch" is confusing: used for SLURM batch and XML query batch

- Rationalize batchQuery.log and GCAM.MI.LogFile in query.py

- Handling of subdir and groupDir is confusing and needs to be rationalized
  - constraint generation
  - queries
  - setup

- Modify log_conf.xml in main wkspc to not create 100MB log data per run
  - tried setting calibration and solver entries to 1 rather than 0 in trial 0, base-0

Test
====
- Finish implementing/testing the queryFile and rewriteSets features
- setup.py installer: test with full install
- write more unit tests
- Test constraint cmds
- Should constraint commands be converted back to plugins?
    - They're for use by biofuel studies only (maybe a sep plugin dir?)
    - Perhaps split out generic function from domain-specific

Features
========

Near-term
---------
- Set CopyAllFiles to True automatically if linking fails on Windows.
  (Implemented; needs testing.)

Medium-term
-----------
- For all top-level command-line funcs, create a dict of default
  values that is used in parseArgs but also passed as a set of
  defaults for the top-level func so caller doesn't have to supply
  all the args. Might be able to extract this from parseArgs parser.

- Specify a simple project without writing custom python code.
    - Create xmlsrc
    - Use built-in scenarios.py that just needs scenario names,
      called from runProj
    - <scenario> has a <files> section similar to configuration.xml
    - support a delete="true" attribute
    - Use stopYear to limit run

    - A "simple" project either:
        - Has manually created sandboxes
        - Has generated sandboxes, but the project only adds to and
          removes from configuration.xml with references to local files.
        - Code doesn't use XmlEditor
            - Already supported using scenarios.py

- Have a flag for batch mode that runs the baseline, then batches
  the policy scenarios with '-d singleton' to cause them to wait
  for the baseline to complete.
  - Maybe --split => split the scenario to run in own batch jobs
    rather than running them all in one big job. If the scenarios
    include baseline and at least one policy scenario, add args
    "-d afterok:<jobid>" to existing value of GCAM.OtherBatchArgs,
    where <jobid> is the id of the baseline job.
  - use subprocess.check_output() and look for "Submitted batch job (\d+)"

- If scenario has unique name among groups, run it even if group isn't specified?
    - Will require restructuring since it's assumed there's one group name

Long-term
---------
- In chart subcommand, allow args to -m (multiplier) to take symbolic
  values like EJ_to_Quad, where these are driven by a builtin table
  with common ones, augmented if needed by a user file, e.g.,

    GCAM.UnitMultipliers = %(ProjectRoot)/etc/multipliers.py

    EJ_per_km2_to_Quad_per_Mha = whatever

    Do this as a python file, e.g., unitConversion.py has values
    gleaned from PNNL files. To see if a value is defined, do:
        import pygcam.unitConversion as units
        getattr(units, 't_Mt', None)    # returns None if not defined

    Rewrite unitConversion.py to have more uniform/predictable naming scheme.

- Allow plotting a marker at the total for a bar

- Allow overlay of, say, line chart using right Y axis on barchart
  using left Y axis, as in "US Land Cover and LUC Emissions"

- Modify handling of named batchfile so it is copied to the tmp file and the
  rest proceeds as with query definition files.

- Make seq="x" optional in project <step> definitions; use order as defined.
  If user is not overriding any steps (most common use case), explicit seq
  nums are not needed.
  - Just run in the order listed
  - Another option is to have an explicit <step after="stepname">, to create
    dependence DAG, which leads toward gcam-driver type of functionality.

- Generalize as many of the Bioenergy and Refining methods as possible
    - Goal should be to not need any sector-based methods

- Integrate gcam-driver code / ideas
    - Consider re-implementing using jug

- Host the xsd files somewhere so they can be referenced in XML
  files, allowing smart editing.

- gcamwrap.py: Take command-line args to:
  - choose config file
  - set scenario name
  - set GHG reporting step
  - set various debugging options (which files to write; file names)
  - restore default values (if given, do this first, then apply rest)

Document
========
- Plug-ins are now loaded on demand, including if a -h flag is used.
  - if a plug-in isn't required, it isn't loaded.
  OPTIMIZATION (later):
  - move constraint, protection, jug, and chart stuff to internal plugins
    to reduce startup time
  - however, need to load internal plugins for auto doc purposes!

- New project step that runs only if GCAM.InMemoryDatabase
  - Create batch file to process all batch queries
  - Create XMLDBDriver.properties file

- New config vars controlling query processing

- New <Parameter active="0"> attribute

- changes to XML format and validation
    - pygcam and also gcammcs (results, parameters, scenarios)

- queryMapping
  - default "level" set in query itself, can override in query list
  - append-values="false" unless any of the queries sets it to "true"

- In project.xml, <defaults> section is now optional

- Document the Subcommand (plugin) protocol
    - class 'Plugin' or variable PluginClass which identifies classname
    - addArgs()
    - run(args, tool)
    - when it gets loaded and run
    - other suggestions, e.g., plugins should use logging

- Assumptions behind setup code


MCS Integration
===============
- Test pyfunc capability and use it to generate protected areas based on distro.

- Failure to run diffs is being reported by Runner.py as success


MCS Cleanup
-----------
- Eliminate scenarios.xml file; this information can be found in project.xml
- Test "constant" distro
- Test (or deprecate) FileChooser
- Test xml db exists before running queries and raise a more targeted error
- If stacked jobs are not yet running, but aborted, set status in db accordingly
  - not needed in using master/worker architecture
  - might also be possible to use sqlite in this approach; only master writes

- When creating the run workspace, make all regular files read-only:

    find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chmod -w

- Optionally Use delta method from SALib instead of the CB method.
- Incorporate SALib sampling as alternative. (Or just use external input files)

MCS Notes
---------
- Needs wrapper (runner.py) or jug-type master-slave approach
    - master-slave avoids stacking jobs in advance
    - jug handles tracking incomplete jobs

- Using jug
    - Slave asks for next task
        - identified by path to .json file, which has all needed args
    - Does stuff that runner.py does now
        - signal handling
        - sets per-task alarm
        - database updates (unless jug results mgmt obviates this)
        - returns status or tuple/dict with more info?

Useful command:

    gcammcs iterate -s1 -e corn -t0,7-11 -c 'gt mcs -S corn -s CI --sandbox {trialDir} --localXml {expDir}/local-xml'


GUI implementation
==================
- Focus on "project"
- Create an edit project.xml
- Run a project
    - select groups, scenarios, and steps to run (checkboxes)
    - select direct or batch mode
        - if direct, show output in window
    - have a 'kill' command for local or batch (sdel?)
- View & update config file


GCAM enhancements to simplify scripting
=======================================
1. Report more meaningful exit statuses

ModelInterface fails but exits with 0 status. GCAM seems to consistently exit with status 1 when it fails.

Ideally, there would be a small number of status codes so a script can do the right thing. Currently I
have to parse error output, which is a nuisance and not robust in the long run.

Useful GCAM exit codes
  0 = success
  1 = failed to read a config file or xml file referenced therein
  2 = failed to solve markets in some period (alternatively, the status could be the failed timestep)

I’m not sure if there are other failure modes.

Useful MI exit codes
  0 = success
  1 = failed to read a batch file or a query file
  2 = query failed (syntax error in XPath, presumably)
  3 = query returned no data (may not always be an error)

2. Quit upon on failure to solve.

When GCAM fails to converge, the task often eats up the entire time allocation spinning uselessly.
If there are reasons that this is sometimes useful, then a cmd-line flag that indicates to quit on
market failure would be helpful. (Or make this the default and have a flag to not quit.)

As it is I’ll probably write code to parse model output to detect this. But it’s generally a waste
of time.

Look for "^ERROR:Currently Unsolved Markets:"

After failing to solve in one or more periods, the climate model is still called, the database is
written, and the model reports:

    Model run completed.
    Model exiting successfully.
