Bugs
====
- Diff without -i is still interpolating.

- There's a subtle problem with repeated use of GcamTool as top-level call.
  First symptom is query list is repeated. Seems to be stale state from
  prior invocation, suggesting a need to re-initialize (class vars?) when
  called from top-level.
  - in any case, all the start-up stuff is rerun needlessly, currently

- To try:
  - Move run dir back to /pic/scratch/plev920


Test
====
- Finish implementing/testing the queryFile and rewriteSets features
- setup.py installer: test with full install
- write more unit tests
- changes to XML format and validation
    - pygcam and also gcammcs (results, parameters, scenarios)

Features
========

Near-term
---------
- Finish checkConstraint.py

- Set CopyAllFiles to True automatically if linking fails on Windows.

Medium-term
-----------
- For all top-level command-line funcs, create a dict of default
  values that is used in parseArgs but also passed as a set of
  defaults for the top-level func so caller doesn't have to supply
  all the args. Might be able to extract this from parseArgs parser.

- Specify a simple project without writing custom python code.
    - Create xmlsrc
    - Use built-in scenarios.py that just needs scenario names,
      called from runProj
    - <scenario> has a <files> section similar to configuration.xml
    - support a delete="true" attribute
    - Use stopYear to limit run

    - A "simple" project either:
        - Has manually creates sandboxes
        - Has generated sandboxes, but the project only adds to and
          removes from configuration.xml with references to local files.
        - Code doesn't use XmlEditor
            - Already supported using scenarios.py

- Have a flag for batch mode that runs the baseline, then batches
  the policy scenarios with '-d singleton' to cause them to wait
  for the baseline to complete.
  - Maybe --split => split the scenario to run in own batch jobs
    rather than running them all in one big job. If the scenarios
    include baseline and at least one policy scenario, add args
    "-d afterok:<jobid>" to existing value of GCAM.OtherBatchArgs,
    where <jobid> is the id of the baseline job.
  - use subprocess.check_output() and look for "Submitted batch job (\d+)"

- If scenario has unique name among groups, run it even if group isn't specified?
    - Will require restructuring since it's assumed there's one group name

Long-term
---------
- In chart subcommand, allow args to -m (multiplier) to take symbolic
  values like EJ_to_Quad, where these are driven by a builtin table
  with common ones, augmented if needed by a user file, e.g.,

    GCAM.UnitMultipliers = %(ProjectRoot)/etc/multipliers.py

    EJ_per_km2_to_Quad_per_Mha = whatever

    Do this as a python file, e.g., unitConversion.py has values
    gleaned from PNNL files. To see if a value is defined, do:
        import pygcam.unitConversion as units
        getattr(units, 't_Mt', None)    # returns None if not defined

    Rewrite unitConversion.py to have more uniform/predictable naming scheme.

- Allow plotting a marker at the total for a bar

- Allow overlay of, say, line chart using right Y axis on barchart
  using left Y axis, as in "US Land Cover and LUC Emissions"

- Modify handling of named batchfile so it is copied to the tmp file and the
  rest proceeds as with query definition files.

- Make seq="x" optional in project <step> definitions; use order as defined.
  If user is not overriding any steps (most common use case), explicit seq
  nums are not needed.
  - Just run in the order listed
  - Another option is to have an explicit <step after="stepname">, to create
    dependence DAG, which leads toward gcam-driver type of functionality.

- Generalize as many of the Bioenergy and Refining methods as possible
    - Goal should be to not need any sector-based methods

- Integrate gcam-driver code / ideas
    - Consider re-implementing using jug

- Host the xsd files somewhere so they can be referenced in XML
  files, allowing smart editing.

Document
========
- New <Parameter active="0"> attribute

- queryMapping
  - default "level" set in query itself, can override in query list
  - append-values="false" unless any of the queries sets it to "true"

- In project.xml, <defaults> section is optional

- Document the Subcommand (plugin) protocol
    - class 'Plugin' or variable PluginClass which identifies classname
    - addArgs()
    - run(args, tool)
    - when it gets loaded and run
    - other suggestions, e.g., plugins should use logging

- Use of pygcam/etc/site.cfg
    - Path is value of $PYGCAM_SITE_CONFIG_FILE

- Assumptions behind setup code

- Eliminate the need for *.pth files for scenarios.py files: we can
  load them directly by pathname.

  # Apparently have to load intermediate module first, as below
  import imp
  modDir  = '/Users/rjp/bitbucket/otaq2016/xmlsrc'  # replace with xmlSrcDir
  modName = 'xmlsrc'

  # load group module level if required
  if args.groupDir:
     modDir  += '/' + args.groupDir
     modName += '.' + args.groupDir
     imp.load_source(modName, modDir)

  mod = imp.load_source(modName + '.scenarios', modDir + '/scenarios.py')


Tasks
=====
- Validate diff cmd
- Test old constraint cmds
- Test land protection cmd
    - Simplify to eliminate complicated cmdline opts?
- Should constraint commands be converted back to plugins?
    - They're for use by biofuel studies only (maybe a sep plugin dir?)
    - Perhaps split out generic function from domain-specific


MCS Integration
===============
- Test pyfunc capability and use it to generate protected areas based on distro.

- Failure to run diffs is being reported by Runner.py as success

- Create in otaq2016 a module (or use scenarios.py, logically) a func
  that takes an XMLInputFile as an input, and calls createProtected:

  createProtected(xmlFile.tree, fraction, landClasses=UnmanagedLandClasses, regions=None)

  But prior to that, have a python func that is passed an np.array
  produced by some distribution, which is stored in the module for use
  when the writeFunc is called. This way the parameter is processed
  normally.


MCS Cleanup
-----------
- Eliminate scenarios.xml file; this information can be found in project.xml
- Test "constant" distro
- Test FileChooser


MCS Notes
---------
- Trial generation should be unaffected
    - document ordering: setup first then gensim

- Needs wrapper (runner.py) or jug-type master-slave approach
    - master-slave avoids stacking jobs in advance
    - jug handles tracking incomplete jobs

- Using jug
    - Slave asks for next task
        - identified by path to .json file, which has all needed args
    - Does stuff that runner.py does now
        - signal handling
        - sets per-task alarm
        - database updates (unless jug results mgmt obviates this)
        - returns status or tuple/dict with more info?

Useful command:

    gcammcs iterate -s1 -e corn -t0,7-11 -c 'gt mcs -S corn -s CI --sandbox {trialDir} --localXml {expDir}/local-xml'


GUI implementation
==================
- Focus on "project"
- Create an edit project.xml
- Run a project
    - select groups, scenarios, and steps to run (checkboxes)
    - select direct or batch mode
        - if direct, show output in window
    - have a 'kill' command for local or batch (sdel?)
- View & update config file


GCAM enhancements to simplify scripting
=======================================
1. Report more meaningful exit statuses

ModelInterface fails but exits with 0 status. GCAM seems to consistently exit with status 1 when it fails.

Ideally, there would be a small number of status codes so a script can do the right thing. Currently I
have to parse error output, which is a nuisance and not robust in the long run.

Useful GCAM exit codes
  0 = success
  1 = failed to read a config file or xml file referenced therein
  2 = failed to solve markets in some period (alternatively, the status could be the failed timestep)

Already exits with code indicating a signal was caught. Seems to be 128 + signum.
    130 on SIGINT (2)
    131 on SIGQUIT (3)
    143 on SIGTERM (15)
    142 on SIGALRM (14)
    158 on SIGUSR1 (30 on OS X)

I’m not sure if there are other failure modes.

Useful MI exit codes
  0 = success
  1 = failed to read a batch file or a query file
  2 = query failed (syntax error in XPath, presumably)
  3 = query returned no data (may not always be an error)

2. Quit upon on failure to solve.

When GCAM fails to converge, the task often eats up the entire time allocation spinning uselessly.
If there are reasons that this is sometimes useful, then a cmd-line flag that indicates to quit on
market failure would be helpful. (Or make this the default and have a flag to not quit.)

As it is I’ll probably write code to parse model output to detect this. But it’s generally a waste
of time.

Look for "^ERROR:Currently Unsolved Markets:"

After failing to solve in one or more periods, the climate model is still called, the database is
written, and the model reports:

    Model run completed.
    Model exiting successfully.
