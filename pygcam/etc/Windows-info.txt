- Install Anaconda with python 2.7

To use pygcam, just run the installer:

    python setup.exe install

To use pygcam and use it in development as well:
- Install git or a GUI version like Tortoise.
- Make a directory to hold your git repository:

    mkdir repo         # the name and location are up to you


- Change into the directory you made and clone the pygcam repository:

    cd {REPO}
    git clone git@bitbucket.org:plevin/pygcam.git

- Create a file called:
  /Users/{username}/AppData/Roaming/Python/Python27/site-packages/pygcam.pth
  (it can have name as long as it has a .pth extension and is in the site-packages
  folder), and add this line:

    {REPO}/pygcam

  with the value {REPO} replaced with the directory you created and into which
  you "cloned" pygcam.
