- Install Anaconda with python 2.7

To use pygcam, just run the installer:

    python setup.exe install

To use pygcam and use it in development as well:
- Install git or a GUI version like Tortoise.
- Make a directory to hold your git repository:

    mkdir bitbucket         # or any name you choose

- Change into that directory and clone the pygcam repository:

    cd bitbucket
    git clone git@bitbucket.org:plevin/pygcam.git

- Add file to /Users/{username}/AppData/Roaming/Python/Python27/site-packages/pygcam.pth
  (or any file name as long as it has a .pth extension), and add this line:

    /Users/{username}/bitbucket/pygcam

  with the value in brackets replaced with your username.
