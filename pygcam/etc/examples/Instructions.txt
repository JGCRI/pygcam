These XML files are provided as examples which you can modify as
required for your project.

The recommended approach is to copy the desired example file to
a new file without "-example" in the name, and to then edit the
copy, ensuring that you maintain the example for reference.

Once you modify the file for your project, you will need to either
reference the file using via command-line arguments in the project
"steps" you define, or by setting values in the configuration file,
${HOME}/.pygcam.cfg.

Here are some example settings to refer to files in this ("etc")
directory within your project directory:

GCAM.LandProtectionXmlFile = %(GCAM.ProjectDir)s/etc/protection.xml
GCAM.RewriteSetsFile	   = %(GCAM.ProjectDir)s/etc/rewriteSets.xml
GCAM.ScenarioSetupFile	   = %(GCAM.ProjectDir)s/etc/scenarios.xml

If you used the "-c" option to the "new" sub-command, the above
settings are added to the new section created in the .pygcam.cfg
file, as comments. To enable these settings, simply edit the file
to remove the leading "#" character.

By default, the "run" sub-command looks for project.xml in the
"etc" directory. The default setting is this:

GCAM.ProjectXmlFile = %(GCAM.ProjectDir)s/etc/project.xml

The file queries.xml is not needed in most cases as the <queries>
element can be defined directly in the project.xml file, and if
defined in the <defaults> section, this can be shared across projects
defined in that file. If you do choose to use a separate queries.xml
file (e.g., to share queries among projects *not* defined in the
same project.xml file), you will need to reference this file from
the query sub-command, as there is not system-defined configuration
variable used for this.
