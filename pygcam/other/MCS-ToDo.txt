* If status == 'killed', resubmit the task.

* Had a few blowouts in saveResults with funky filename. Why only occasionally?
  /people/plev920/mcs/paper1/sims/s001/000/320/baseline/diffs/carbon_intensity-baseline-baseline.csv

* Trials are not setting running status if either added via -a or via newly added engines.

* Got this:
  2017-06-24 21:50:20,775 WARNING setRunStatus failed to find record for runId 8835

* Need a simple test suite to try out a few things and understand error modes
  * Start cluster with N engines
  * Add engines to running cluster
  * Add tasks to running cluster (some tasks are added, others go "missing". Why?)
  * Recover from engine being killed
  * Recover from failures getting results (unclear when/why)


* Simplify database handling of duration
  * Have worker track start / end time, store these in result structure
  * Master can compute duration and write this to run table

* If exactly the desired number of engines are run, but all don't start, some will
  start new trials without adequate time remaining.
  * Engines could track their run-time to see if they should start new jobs or not.
  * Probably should double time required per job when setting walltime

* When adding engines and tasks, the new tasks' run.status isn't updated from new
  as it is with jobs created by master itself.

* Add a -q option to engine command to allow additional engines on other queue

* Adding runs sort of worked -- 3 of 10 got started right away; the rest might still run.
* Adding engines did not work. Added 2 jobs (10 engines) but additional runs weren't started.
  - unclear if this is a problem adding jobs or adding engines
  - ah! added another job with the already added engines, and the job started right away

* If results are found, reduce length of wait from 30 to 3 sec. If no results after 3
  iterations, increase back to 30 sec.

* Weak element of current design is that if trial completes and master doesn't update
  the data base, the run results are lost.
  * Save results object to results.json in expDir
  * Have subcmd that scavenges for these by:
    * rename(results.json, results.json-)
    * write results to database (ensure idempotency)
    * if write succeeds, delete results.json-

* Provide a way to run only the saving of results to database given all result CVS files
  * Should be able to use --noGCAM and (not yet implemented) --noQueries so that only
    post-processing steps (verify that these are CI and computing results to send
    back to master.py to save to the DB).

* Looks like 2000 runs completed on savio, but DB wasn't updated.

* Might be an issue with one client calling get_result() on task queued by other client.
  * Try using db_query to get this instead?

$ find . -name Climate_forcing-baseline.csv > finished.txt

$ wc -l */finished.txt
   978 000/finished.txt
   953 002/finished.txt
   204 003/finished.txt
  2135 total

* Need to test runsim --loopOnly : Why not DB writes?
* Need way to see what's actually running
* Need better diagnostics when failures occur.
  * Test structure of results & identify unexpected conditions
* Exceptions are blowing out engines. Shouldn't ever happen.

Command clean-up
-----------------

The following are probably obsolete or can be merged into other commands:
- addexp : this is now automatic. Is there ever a need to add one manually?
- delsim : (used to be initdb) may be useful; not clear. Maybe just an option to gensim.
- newsim : build this into gensim as well. Just builds out the Workspace copy; do
  this if not found, or if a flag indicates to rebuild it.


Logging stuff
-------------
Consolidate log output to make this process debuggable!


API
---
Create function to read inputs and results from db and
create joined or separate DataFrames from these.

Redesign analytic and plotting functions to expect use these.

Should be compatible with SALib (or layer built on that).

Build MonteCarlo class in sensitivity.py to conform with
other versions.

CorrelationDef.py appears unused. Is this all now handled in
XMLParameterFile?

Merge pygcamSupport.py into appropriate modules.


tsplot
------
The monkey patch at
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34293687/standard-deviation-and-errors-bars-in-seaborn-tsplot-function-in-python
might be preferable to current approach.

Documentation
-------------
- Setup read the docs project

MCS / SALib
-----------
- Test both adding engines dynamically and adding runs.
  - Test runsim --addTrials

- shutdownWhenIdle happens in all cases

- It would be useful to have conditional evaluation in project.xml and scenarios.xml
  e.g., to have different behavior in MCS mode.

- Need to be able to
  - Add engines to existing cluster
    - gt engine does this but might want to specify a different queue
    - currently it reuses the batch file created by startCluster. No need to do this.

- Seem to have solved the sqlite thread problem, but the start/end times are not
  being updated. Is this because the call-back is registered in one thread only?

- Modify legacy approach to sampling and SA to look like SALib versions, i.e.,
  subclass sensitivity.SensitivityAnalysis and write _sample / _analyze methods.

- Shouldn't be necessary to run queries for gensim. See what side-effect is required
  and remove it to separate function.
  - one side-effect is storing parameter names/descs in DB.
  - test by commenting out runQueries() and see what breaks.

- Document: If SALib methods are used, must define as triangle or uniform
  so fixed max and min.

- Create Workspace and Sandbox classes that encapsulate the diffs
  between stochastic and non-stochastic runs, simplifying the creation
  of these directories and their various symlinks (and avoiding the
  currently redundant links), and access to various logical paths.

- Generate tornado plot from Sobol analysis.
  - Should "just work" once values are in the database
  - See how Platypus presents Sobol results.

- Seems too fragile currently
  - Generation of trial data in baseline
  - If process fails, should back out and files written (e.g., to Workspace)
  - Needs to be idempotent

Once paper1 analysis is done:
- Create new branch
- Drop InValue row and col columns from schema, Database, uses
- Add variable number?
  - Useful only for independent (non-shared) RVs, which currently don't work.

- Create an "export" subcommand that can output inputs/outputs in various
  formats, e.g., for SALib, for EMAWorkbench? and so on.

- Also, "plotsim" to provide various types of plots
- Also, "sa" to run the global sensitivity analysis associated with
  the sampling method used in "gensim".

- Might be able to eliminate distinction between static and dynamic

- Merge mcs-cluster.py into analysis.py

- Test each new sub-command
  - Step through all code
  - Fix config vars one at a time.

- Have "newsim" command append to .pygcam.cfg as "new" does (optional)

- Make MCS.Years obsolete
  - need single point of modification, either project.xml or config file, not both!
  - in the meantime, might check that the designated years are correct in the database

- Modify XMLConfigFile to use xmlEditor since same features exist there?
  - different calling assumptions might make this difficult

Master/worker architecture
---------------------------
- Maybe one more architectural revision is required:
  - start loop by collecting available engines and initializing new ones (Add to a set?)
  - see if controller adds these to the pool and uses them automatically
  - Or does master send the function to the client, which means the execute('import ...;) is not needed?
    - commenting it out seems to work anyway, so yeah.

- Master quit, presumably after receiving results, but before saving to DB.
  - How to recover from this? Probably a using the task DB.

- Flush queue stats so counts are accurate for running 'runsim' command?
  - add runsim flag for this

- Why the 3 sec delay between adding results for each run? Looks like programmed sleep.
  - runsim keeps processing results long after all the engines have exited. Speed it up!

- Seems workers are added for 30min only.
  - Check logic on that. Might be adding workers up to 300 before adding time?
  - Added engines, but didn't seem to be picked up by master, not sure though. CHECK LOGS.

- Quitting and restarting runsim didn't work.
  - Next time after adding engines, try runsim with --addTrials (-a) flag
  - Looks like newly added tasks (via -a flag) tried to compute diff between
    baseline and baseline (e.g., carbon_intensity-baseline-baseline.csv) WHY?
    - Might be stale info from context? Must excise this approach! ***

- Test that timeout signal is making it through to setting database result

- Rather than calling ipcluster -n 0 and ipengine --daemonize, just call
  ipcontroller and sbatch the generated engine batch file.
  - Generate these into profile dir, but set the working dir for log output
    to {simdir}/logs

- Runsim prints both console and "file" log messages
  - need to be able to assign log level and log file per module. Can't have it both ways.

- Consolidate logging / console msgs
  - GCAM output going to exe/logs/main_log.txt
  - Engine output going to trialDir/log/{scenario}.log
  - Non-GCAM (logger) output going to ~/tmp/slurm-*.log files
  - unclear where controller is logging to with --log-to-file=True

- Eliminate args.json; just pass this info from cmd line from
  (revised) runsim to clients as a dict via vars(args).
  - No need to write this to disk or to pass via environment vars.

- Setup stuff
  - Automate configuration of ipyparallel files (ipcluster and ipcontroller files)

  - conda update conda
  - conda install packaging appdirs
  - python setup.py develop in pygcam and pygcam-mcs

  - Create new profile:
    ipython profile create --parallel --profile=pygcam

  - on PIC set these in ~/.ipython/profile_pygcam/ipcontroler_config.py:
    # seems to be a name changed... in 5.2.0 there are only
    # c.HubFactory.client_ip and c.HubFactory.engine_ip
    c.HubFactory.ip = '*'

    # Set engines to use Slurm, but leave controller on login node to avoid
    # hogging an additional node for this mostly-idle task
    c.IPClusterEngines.engine_launcher_class = 'Slurm'

    # It’s also useful on systems with shared filesystems to run the engines
    # in some scratch directory. This can be set with:
    c.IPEngineApp.work_dir = u'/path/to/scratch/'

- Delete after harvesting useful bits:
  - Runner.py
  - QueueRunner.py
  - runGcamTool.py
  - CorePackage.py
  - XMLScenarioFile

- Revise file layout to minimize need for copying (see notes in pygcam files)
