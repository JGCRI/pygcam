Release 1.0
===========

Must Do
-------

* Testing
  - Test major functionality on Mac and Linux
  - Install on PIC and test there as well
  - Test correlations still work
  - Matplotlib fix: hopefully this can go away

* Installation
  - Test environment downloads from anaconda.org on all 3 platforms into Anaconda 5
  - Add pygcam=1.0 to these once it's working and uploaded!

  - Test pyinstaller version, too. Or maybe drop this?

* Features
  - Get GUI working for basic commands? Would be nice for the tutorial...

##############
  - Modify render() to use action.value if not None to maintain state (shouldn't be necessary, should it?)
##############

   - Speed up analysis.py using method in gui tornado plot

* Documentation
  - Document setup of ipyparallel for testing on Mac (and Windows?) and running on Linux
  - MCS: writeFunc, trialFunc other undocumented features?

* Cleanup
   - Use -l flag to specify log for ModelInterface. Also use --version to see what's running.


Nice to do
-----------

* Installation
  - 'newuser' plugin that takes args on cmd line and sets up basic .pygcam.cfg
    - Interactively request paths if not specified on command line?

* MCS improvements
  - database cleanup
  - test ipp to see if fixing -a flag and spurious key error are do able in time

* Cleanup
  - Review ToDos and TBDs and resolve the easiest ones.
  - Consolidate generic code from sectorEditors and xmlEditor
  - Refactor API as per discussion with Robert
  - landProtection.py has become redundant in places and should be refactored.

* Features
  - pygcam 3.0 version
    - requires separate YAML files
  - web-based config file editor?
  - In GUI, add  methods to generate choices (e.g., groups, scenarios) to choose from
