pygcam

The pygcam package is currently under initial development. It is a Python package
that will provide a classes, functions, and scripts for working with GCAM.

Intended functionality

* Functions for manipulating GCAM's XML input files and setting up experiments

* Functions to run queries and perform basic manipulation of results (e.g.,
  interpolating between timesteps, computing differences between scenarios).

* Scripts that provide flexible command-line interfaces to the functionality
  provided by the library.

How do I get set up?

* Run this command on the included setup.py file:

    python setup.py install

Who do I talk to?
